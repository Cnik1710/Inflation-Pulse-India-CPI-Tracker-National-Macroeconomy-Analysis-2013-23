---

## üéØ Objective

To develop a **structured, visual, and data-driven analysis** of India‚Äôs Consumer Price Index (CPI) to uncover actionable insights that support **economic decision-making** at both policy and strategic levels.

**Project Purpose:**

* Identify key contributors to inflation by analyzing **category-wise CPI weights** and **index changes**.
* Evaluate **historical and recent inflation trends**, both Year-on-Year (YoY) and Month-on-Month (MoM).
* Assess the impact of **major global and domestic events**‚Äîsuch as COVID-19 and international oil-price fluctuations‚Äîon India‚Äôs inflation dynamics.
* Create an **interactive dashboard** that transforms complex CPI data into clear visuals for policymakers, strategists, and analysts.

**Key KPIs:**

* Overall CPI inflation trend (annual & monthly)
* Category-wise inflation contribution
* Pre- vs. Post-COVID inflation shifts
* Correlation of crude oil prices with fuel & food inflation

**Deliverables:**

* Excel dashboard
* Presentation slides summarizing insights
* Concise analytical report

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Overview & Schema

**Data Source:**

* **Primary:** National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI), Government of India
* **Supplementary:** Monthly crude oil prices (Brent/Indian Basket) from Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC), Govt. of India

**Time Period:** January 2013 ‚Äì December 2023 (11 years, monthly frequency)

**Data Structure & Metrics:**

* **Index Types:** CPI‚ÄìRural (CPI-R), CPI‚ÄìUrban (CPI-U), CPI‚ÄìCombined (General)
* **Categories:** 20+ CPI sub-groups aggregated into broader buckets ‚Äî *Food & Beverages, Fuel & Light, Housing, Clothing & Footwear, Transport, Healthcare, Miscellaneous*
* **Calculated Metrics:** YoY inflation %, MoM % change, pre/post-COVID comparisons, correlation matrices

---

## üíª Tech Stack

**Tools:**

* **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation
* **PowerPoint:** Presentation and final dashboard snapshots

---

## üìà Methodology & Analysis

**Approach:**

* Grouped detailed subcategories (e.g., *Cereals, Beverages, Milk*) into macro-economic buckets like *Food, Clothing, Energy, Health*, etc.
* Computed **YoY and MoM inflation rates** using CPI indices.
* Calculated category contributions ensuring **100% total weight alignment** with CPI basket.
* Conducted **correlation analysis** using `=CORREL()` (e.g., oil vs. CPI).
* Compared **Pre- vs. Post-COVID** inflation trends (cutoff: Mar 2020).
* Addressed missing values using **3-month moving average**.
* Created **line, bar, and pie charts** with slicers for interactivity.

**Key Excel Functions Used:**
`=IF()`, `=AVERAGE()`, custom percentage-change formulas

**Data Preparation & Processing:**
* **Data Cleaning:** Missing observations handled and imputed with 3-month moving averages.
* **Aggregation:** Detailed subcategories were aggregated into broader economic buckets (Food, Energy, Essentials) for macro-analysis.

## ‚ùì Problem Statements

**Key Questions:**

* **1. CPI Category Contribution**

  *  Identify contribution of major CPI categories (Food, Energy, Health, etc.)
  *  Determine which category has the **highest weight** in CPI composition

* **2. Year-on-Year CPI Inflation Trends**

  *  Analyze YoY inflation (Rural + Urban) since 2017
  *  Identify the **year with highest inflation rate** and reasons behind it

* **3. Month-on-Month Food Inflation (Jun‚Äô22 ‚Äì May‚Äô23)**

  *  Study 12-month food inflation trajectory
  *  Highlight months with **highest and lowest food inflation**
  *  Determine the **biggest contributor** within the Food category

* **4. COVID-19 Impact on CPI (Pre vs. Post Mar‚Äô20)**

  *  Compare inflation before and after pandemic onset
  *  Focus on Healthcare, Food, and Essential Services inflation

* **5. Oil Price Fluctuations vs. CPI (2021‚Äì23)**

  *  Analyze how **crude oil price movements** affected India‚Äôs CPI
  *  Identify **CPI categories** most responsive to oil price changes

---

## üí° Key Insights

**Top Findings:**

* *Food & Beverages* consistently the largest inflation driver (~45% CPI weight).
* *Fuel & Light* exhibited highest volatility, correlated with oil prices (**r ‚âà 0.82**).
* Post-COVID era (2020‚Äì22) saw **essentials inflation surge**, discretionary items stabilize.
* Urban inflation overtook rural inflation post-2021 due to **housing and services**.
* Headline CPI exceeded **RBI‚Äôs 6% tolerance band** multiple times, reflecting supply shocks.
* Fuel price spikes showed **ripple effects on food inflation**, highlighting cost-push dynamics.

**Supporting Metrics:**

* Avg. YoY CPI growth (2020‚Äì23): **6.4%**
* Max inflation: **7.8% (Fuel & Light, 2022)**
* Correlation (Oil vs. CPI): **r = 0.82**

## üìç Conclusion

**Summary:**

* **Food inflation** remains the primary driver of India‚Äôs overall CPI due to its nearly 50% weight ‚Äî making supply-side stability critical.
  
* **2022 inflation peaks** exposed vulnerabilities in supply chain resilience and dependency on global commodities, especially fuel and food.
  
* **Month-on-month volatility** in essentials directly impacts lower-income households, emphasizing the need for:
  * Food inflation 
  * 2022 inflation peaks 
  * Month-on-month 
  * Real-time agricultural price monitoring
  * Timely policy interventions (MSP, stock release)
  * Strengthened logistics and distribution systems

* Inflation management requires **real-time price monitoring** and **timely interventions**. Forward-looking preparedness ‚Äî governments must anticipate lagged inflation spikes post-crisis and ensure stability in core consumer categories (food, healthcare, housing).


* Oil price fluctuations have a cascading impact across sectors; hence, **Fuel policies and tax structures (subsidies, tax control/calibration)**, **global oil market monitoring** crucial for macroeconomic stability.  

* For businesses and investors, tracking **CPI-linked sector analysis (FMCG, logistics, energy)** can guide smarter pricing and risk management decisions,
aids in hedging and informed portfolio planning.
