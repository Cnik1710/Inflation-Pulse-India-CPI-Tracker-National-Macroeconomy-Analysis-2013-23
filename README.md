# CPI (Consumer Price Index) Data Analysis Case Study

This analysis will require breaking down CPI data by broader categories, identifying trends in inflation over time, and correlating external economic factors like oil price fluctuations with domestic inflation. Here's a structured approach to tackling each question:

1. Category Contribution to CPI 
   - Aggregate the subcategories into broader categories (Food, Energy, Transportation, etc.).  
   - Calculate each category's share in the total CPI basket.  
   - Identify the category with the highest contribution.

2. Year-on-Year CPI Growth Since 2017  
   - Compute Y-o-Y percentage changes in overall CPI (rural + urban).  
   - Visualize trends with a line graph.  
   - Identify the year with the highest inflation and research the key drivers (e.g., supply chain issues, policy changes, global crises).

3. Retail Inflation Trends (Nov 2022 - May 2023)  
   - Analyze month-on-month inflation changes for the food category.  
   - Identify months with the highest and lowest inflation.  
   - Find the food subcategory with the most significant impact on overall food inflation.
     
4. COVID-19 Impact on CPI (Pre vs. Post March 2020)  
   - Compare inflation trends before and after the first lockdown.  
   - Focus on healthcare, food, and essential services.  
   - Identify inflation spikes and potential reasons (e.g., supply chain disruptions, demand shifts).

5. Impact of Global Oil Price Fluctuations (2021-2023)  
   - Analyze monthly oil price changes and CPI trends.  
   - Use correlation analysis to find which CPI categories are most affected by oil prices.
