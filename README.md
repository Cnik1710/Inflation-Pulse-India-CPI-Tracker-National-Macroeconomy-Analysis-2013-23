## CPI (Consumer Price Index) Data Analysis Case Study

## Overview
This case study aims to analyze India's CPI data to uncover key trends, evaluate inflationary pressures, and assess external economic factors affecting domestic inflation. The study is structured into five key areas, each addressing critical aspects of CPI inflation.

## 1. Category Contribution to CPI
- Aggregate the subcategories into broader categories (e.g., Food, Energy, Transportation, etc.).
- Calculate each category's share in the total CPI basket.
- Identify the category with the highest contribution to the CPI calculation.

## 2. Year-on-Year CPI Growth Since 2017
- Compute Year-over-Year (Y-o-Y) percentage changes in overall CPI (rural + urban).
- Visualize trends with a line graph.
- Identify the year with the highest inflation and research key contributing factors (e.g., supply chain issues, policy changes, global crises).

## 3. Retail Inflation Trends (Nov 2022 - May 2023)
- Analyze month-on-month inflation changes for the food category.
- Identify months with the highest and lowest inflation.
- Determine the food subcategory with the most significant impact on overall food inflation.

## 4. COVID-19 Impact on CPI (Pre vs. Post March 2020)
- Compare inflation trends before and after the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020).
- Focus on categories like healthcare, food, and essential services.
- Identify inflation spikes and potential causes, such as supply chain disruptions and demand shifts.

## 5. Impact of Global Oil Price Fluctuations (2021-2023)
- Analyze monthly oil price changes and their correlation with CPI trends.
- Identify the CPI categories most affected by oil price fluctuations using correlation analysis.

## Data and Methodology
- **Data Source:** National Statistical Office (NSO), India.
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Excel.
- **Analysis Approach:** Data aggregation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key inflationary drivers.
